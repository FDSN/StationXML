In geophysics, we often work with instrument responses in the frequency domain
as they are simpler to combine and manipulate 
For instrument responses specified in the time domain, we must first
transform the response of the frequency domain using one or more transforms.
Depending on the application, one or more of the following transforms may be used:
The Fourier Transform, the Laplace Transform and the z-Transform.
